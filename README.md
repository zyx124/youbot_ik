# youbot_ik
youbot inverse kinematics for the 5 Dof youbot arm.
The cpp code is modified based on the hello_world_demo of kuka youbot.

The diagrams are shown below to demonstrate how the coordinates are set up and how to obtain the geometric solution.



The arm of youBot only has 5 Dof and thus there are limitations in its motion in 3D space.
